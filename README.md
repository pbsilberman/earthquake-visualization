# Earthquake Visualization

This is for Level 1 of the Leaflet homework assignment. The earthquakes are displayed on a world map. The radius of the circles correspond to the magnitude 
of the earthquake. Additionally, they're color coded for ease of interpretation, similarly based on magnitude. When clicked on, the location, date and 
magnitude are displayed.
